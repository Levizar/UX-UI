# UX UI Design

Design = what does user need?
=> From tools to users

"Why do you want this tool?"

every designers' method converge to the same goal

method : 5 why, double diamond

## story of designing

In the beginning, form follows function. There were no choice. You can't make a guitar as you make a piano.

Affordance : capacity of an object to talk about him with his shape.
You know what the object is for when you see it.
A chair is made to sit on.
A table is made to put object on.

Thus the work of a designer was to innove in the shape of this object.

With computer, everything change.
The computer and his component don't talk about them thus change the designer work.

How should people interact with the CPU of a computer?
The interaction design was born.
Great character that had a huge role in the field of the GUI, the graphical user interface:

- Bill Verplanck
- Bill Buxton

Story about the first numerical watch in 1980:

When you have this watch, you had a big manual delevered with it to change the hour.
There was no interaction design.

You changed the hour once then you forget how to do it and when the time comes to change it for winter hour, you had lost the manual and you were desesperately pushing on everybutton of the watch.
Moreover, the manual was simply a "small traduction" of engineer's manual for CPU.
That's not the simpliest way to do it.

## Interaction design & skeuomorphisme

It's all about knowing who is the user and how do I have to make my watch to be sure that the user will innately knows how to do it without forcing him to read any manual.

skeuomorphisme: make your object work like something that already exist.
If you try to fly, at first you innately know that you have to make wings.

=> story about the Iphone

1. the scroll was made like a page of a book
   We were just in a period of book, this it was the best object to focus on.
2. shaking for the CTRL + Z like the old game.

People become slowly accomodate to what they have.
So, it evolves slowly and you always have to look back at what was just behind you.

skeuomorphisme is all about making innovation without pushing those too far.

## How does a human work

### A story of control : Control theory

"How do you do?"

<!-- Insert the photo here -->

!("How do you do?")[]

How can I physically do one thing ?

That is the first question as a designer.
People aren't the same and can't do the same things.
Kids can use smartphone way better than we do.
His work partner can type on her computer while talking to him.
She opens thousands of tabs in google while he is affraid of having more than 3.
It's astonishing for him because he just can't do it.
It's because people use it by different way and there is a thousand way of using the same tool.

The operation of an user can be discret OR continuous

Discret operation are a lot of operation are condensated in one big operation.
It's like Launching a ball to a wall.

Continous operation are operations that need a constant but small "amount" of attention.

It's two different way of attention.

On a website we are using a mixed part of those.

In a plane, there are 2 people. The guy "driving" the plane isn't the one pushing on all the buttons.
Using a mix of those two attentions is hard because you have to switch from continuous to discret and vice-versa.

### A story of perception

"How do you feel ?"

You aren't everytime i nthe same situation with the same confort.

Website are usually simpler in the smartphone shape/form(?).

Designer think that if you check a website with your smartphone, you are probably not in your sofa because navigating with a computer is easier. The screen is bigger, the mouse is easy and can move everywhere.

The condition in which you are using the product is important.
How you feel at the moment is important.
How you feel using the product is important.

Reference to the yogourt designer working on the sound of the spool when it touch the bottom of the yogourt.

You always have to ask on how to people ask.
But people doesn't provide with a good answer, not because they aren't honest but because they don't really know how to express it.
You have to make hypothesis on the answer.

### A story of knowledge : how to give the method?

Some people needs a "path", other just need a "map".
It depends of the context.

If you are in search of a precise information. Having a path is pretty boring. Give me the map, I know what I'm looking for. I know where I am going.

In another context, when I'm discovering something, I like to have someone handling my hand and driving me through the discover.

The designer's work is to know what he has to apply in a precise context.

In one hand, if you apply the map to someone that doesn't know how to do, the personn will be lost.
On the other hand, if you try to give the path to someone who precisely what he wants to do and how he wants to do it, he will probably become angry.

#### The distributor example:

1. the Coke distributor:

   If you have a linear way to do something, you can do a path way.
   For example, the distributor of Coke.
   It's very efficient, very fast. You don't even know to think about what you are doing.
   You are going from top to bottom.
   Put your money, choose something, grab it and go away.

   But there is a reverse side.

   If something goes wrong, for example, the product doesn't fall.
   How do you get your product?

   Moreover, you can't show people the thing work because it would break the simplicity of the design.
   Thus, it's very opac.
   So, when something goes wrong. Everything is broken.

2. the numerical distributor:

   The system is totaly different. It's the map way.
   You have to chose something between tons of product. It takes more times.
   The system is exposed. You can see what is going on inside.
   If something is stuck, you can see where you are in the process. You can try so self resolve the problem.
   But then, the system is way lesser effecient.
   It works slowly.

#### What is intuition/natural

Breath, eat, suxion is natural, almost everything else isn't natural.
Every other skill is acquired due to cerebral plasticity.
Neuronal connexion are changing all over.
If a gesture is made everytime, everyday, you will end up being expert in doing that gesture.
The brain will change its structure.

Everysingle brain of the word is slightly different. There is no two exact same brain.
Speaking other languages make you think different.
Solve a problem in a language is different than doing it in another one.

When you encounter something new, you activate a precise part of your brain.
The problem solving part.
It makes you thinking slow.
The brain is printing a pattern. It gives a result, probably terrible.
Then you make it again and again and again and again.

It's like playing music/guitare.
It's pretty hard at the beginning. You have to practice over and over.
One day it becomes "natural".
You are going from the "think slow" to the "think fast".

Off-topic: Living is nearly chosing what you want to go from "think slow" to "think fast".

#### Designing/Redesigning : Who am I am designing for?

You can't use yourself as a reference.
For example, if a designer go a factory and decide to redesign a machine because it's not simple ect.
But the operator is used to this "complicated" machine. For him, it's not a problem and if you make it way simpler, he will be angry at you. (ig. path vs map)

Thus you have to think for you are designing for.
Make a printer for an experienced user is not the same job as making one for a newbie.

But it's not because the user has an automatism that you can't questione the functionement.
The user is full of automatism but he can have a bad judgement and start an automated procedure and will end up in a bad situation because it will not solve it's problem.

#### Making Stable design system :

You have to design a system to think about nearly every usage that can be made with your system.
If you don't do that, you end up in a system that is not stable.

A stable system is a system that end up working in nearly every situation even if the user is using it in a way he wasn't suppose to.

An unstable system is a system that end up not working because the user made one or several action that wasn't predicted.

## How to design?

Your worst ennemy as a designer is yourself.
You are full of bias.
You are tempted to make system for yourself.

The main sentence as a designer is "You don't know what you don't know !".

```
You don't know what you don't know !
```

You know what you know.
You can know that you don't know something.
But most of the time, you don't know that you don't know.

```
You think that you know but you definely don't !
```

Story about the designing:

They designed a furniture for clients with kids.
They made a furniture for TV that was kid.
The TV was too high for the kid to turn on the TV.
Thus, it's a faillure for the designers.

They didn't bring a child to make a test. They thought it would be enough to put the TV 20 cm lower. It turns out it wasn't !
They had to add a small furniture on the ground for the kid to climb on.
He said it was awful but the TV couldnt be put lower.
They thought they know.

The moral is that you have to questione every single idea.
Why are you making that? Will it fit to the user?

### The double diamond

Two phases seperated in two phases:

- design the right thing
  - Divergeance: Give tons of idea to open what is possible to do.
  - convergeance: Reduce the ideas to what has to be done.
- design the thing
  - Divergeance: Give tons of idea to how will we do the thing.
  - convergeance: Reduce the ideas to a decision on how it will be done.

```
Do not code !
The code come at the end of the design process !
```

If you start coding too soon, you can end up in a situation in which what you've made does not fit the client's need.

### who are the users ?

You can't answer this question in one sentence like "the young/old people", "everyone".
If you make your site for those people, you will do it for no-one or yourself.
Which segment of the population are you targeting?

Even big brand know that they are targeting a segment of the population and they don't target 100% of the population.
For example the tone music of Microsoft/Google/Apple are very different despite the fact they are trying to target as much people as possible.

You need to create character filled with anecdots in which people can suits.
A character for which you can deduct their feelings and their values.

Exercice, create a personae

Make case study (étude utilisateur)

Landing page : can I drag the target into a small website
Objective: to not work on a fantasm

Have a list of word and tell it to the client.

You can do a "paperprototyping" to create a mock up of the site.
Thus the client can see a version that is nearly what the site will look like.
Let the target interact with the mockup.
At this point, you can have resolve a lot of design problem before you have even type a single lne of code.
It takes time but it saves a lot of code iteration and avoid the case we've seen before. (the end product doesn't fit the client's need.)

But don't waste too much time on the mockup. It has to stay a mockup, not to be the endsite.
It shouldn't be use to be a display of the final product.
It has to be made to be tested!
So we can get the feelings of the target and we can know what they are trying to do.
